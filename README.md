# Desktop Draw

Example of an application that draws the background in real-time

This code sample is in eternal debt to Gerald Degeneve and his [post at `codeproject.com`](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/856020/Draw-Behind-Desktop-Icons-in-Windows-plus)

Only tested on Windows 10, but should work on Windows 8 too, according to the post above.

The result is animated and random.
